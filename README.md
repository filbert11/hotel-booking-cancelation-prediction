# Hotel Booking Prediction

## Objectives
The aim of this project is to predict hotel booking cancellation using machine learning models (ML) with features of the customers being taken into consideration during the prediction.
It enhances the overbooking strategy as hotels could accurately assign the number of rooms to be overbooked.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "Hotel booking demand datasets" by:
Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida, Luis Nunes, Hotel booking demand datasets, Data in Brief, Volume 22, 2019, Pages 41-49, ISSN 2352-3409,
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.11.126. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191)

It consist of data from 2 hotels (H1 and H2) with approximately 119,000 rows and 30 columns. 

## Executive Summary
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Pre-processing of Data
3. Training of Machine learning models
4. Evaluation of Machine learning models

## Conclusion
Neural network is the best machine learning model and achieved f1 score of 0.81.
