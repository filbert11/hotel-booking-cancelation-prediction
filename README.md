# Hotel Booking Prediction

## Background
Maximizing profit is a known goal for all businesses and having 100% occupancy is an ideal situation for hotel owners to optimize their revenue. 
However, this goal is unattainable due to last-minute cancellations and no-shows.
Therefore, hotels engage in profit maximizing strategy such as overbooking where hotel accepts more customersâ€™ booking than the number of rooms available. 

## Objectives
The aim of this project is to predict hotel booking cancellation using machine learning models (ML) with features of the customers being taken into consideration during the prediction.
It enhances the overbooking strategy as hotels could accurately assign the number of rooms to be overbooked.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "Hotel booking demand datasets" by:
Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida, Luis Nunes, Hotel booking demand datasets, Data in Brief, Volume 22, 2019, Pages 41-49, ISSN 2352-3409,

It consist of data from 2 hotels (H1 and H2) with approximately 119,000 rows and 30 columns. 

## Project Notebook Outline
The project is split into 4 parts of the ipynb:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Pre-processing of Data
3. Training of Machine learning models
4. Evaluation of Machine learning models

## Conclusion
Neural network is the best machine learning model and achieved f1 score of 0.81.
